Ansible installer for wildbook, an AI software for identifying species like Whale Sharks as individuals

## Description

Ansible recipes for automatic installation of Wildbook, an AI software for identifying species like Whale Sharks (Rhincodon typus) as individuals.

Our goal is to track whale shark individuals, and discover if they are traveling between places like Coco's Island and mainland Costa Rica, or Coco's Island and Galapagos Island, which would have a great value for conservation efforts. This can be done with minimal disturbance to the sharks which can be captured during dives at a respectful distance, or with ROV cameras such as [Trident underwater drone](https://www.sofarocean.com/products/trident) or "camera traps" like bait cams.

The ansible recipe will be based on this [install guide](https://www.wildbook.org/doku.php?id=documentation#installation).
